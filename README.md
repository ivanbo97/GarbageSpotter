# About GarbageSpotter

   With this application each person is capable of registering encountered polluted regions by recording its geographic coordinates and taking a picture of the polluted place.
After that he can upload the collected information to a server. All polluted places can be visualized in Open Street Map after clicking on the corresponding waypoints.
Having that information people can organize events for cleaning the polluted places. WAMP server running on localhost is used in the test version of the application. You can find the php scripts in folder : garbage_proj and foront-end code in garbage_proj/osm. Classes providing the main functuionality of the app can be found at: https://github.com/ivanbo97/GarbageSpotter/tree/master/app/src/main/java/com/example/garbagespotter 

You can record the location of the polluted place even without having mobile or internet connection because this application obtains data directly from the GPS receiever. Once you have internet, you can upload the recorded places and pictures to the server.
 ##### ***Planning for an update related to changing the waypoint icons and photos after cleaning of the place has been done.
